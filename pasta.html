        <h2>A creamy garlic dish</h2>
        <p>This Alfredo-like dish is packed with garlic flavors in a creamy, cheesy sauce. You can serve it as is (especially for those picky eaters) or add a protein to make it a heartier meal.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 Tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>3 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 1/2 Tablespoons dried parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a medium pan over medium heat. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add butter and stir constantly until melted. Pour in 3 cups chicken broth; add pepper and salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add spaghetti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Add more chicken broth if pasta starts to stick to the pan.</li>
            <li>Add Parmesan cheese, cream, and parsley and mix until thoroughly combined. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
